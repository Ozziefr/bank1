      <h1>The Founding Era and 12th Century</h1>
      <h2>Late 100s - Early 200s: The Formation of Fredonia</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Late 100s:</strong> The settlement of Fredonia was established
        by five barbarians led by King Xyz. This group of settlers chose a
        strategic location near fertile lands and a defensible hill, ideal for
        building a new society. King Xyz implemented rudimentary laws and
        organized a small, but functional, community.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Early 200s:</strong> Fredonia began to attract new settlers from
        surrounding areas. As the population grew, the settlement evolved into a
        burgeoning kingdom. King Xyz continued to strengthen the nascent nation
        through diplomatic alliances with neighboring tribes and by
        consolidating internal power.
      </p>

      <h2>Early 300s - Mid 500s: Expansion and Stabilization</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>305:</strong> The kingdom experienced its first major external
        conflict with the Siege of the Northern Fort, where Fredonia
        successfully defended its territory against a coalition of neighboring
        tribes. This victory secured Fredonia’s position and led to a period of
        relative peace.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>340:</strong> King Alden, a successor of King Xyz, initiated the
        Great Expansion Campaign. This campaign aimed to extend Fredonia’s
        borders and integrate nearby lands into the kingdom. The campaign was
        largely successful, resulting in increased agricultural production and
        economic prosperity.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>470:</strong> The Cultural Renaissance of Fredonia began, marked
        by significant advancements in art, architecture, and governance. During
        this period, the kingdom built impressive structures, such as fortified
        walls and grand halls, and developed a sophisticated legal system.
      </p>

      <h2>Early 600s - Early 800s: Prosperity and Internal Challenges</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>614:</strong> The Conflict of the Eastern Tribes emerged when
        eastern tribes rebelled against Fredonia’s expanding influence. The
        conflict was resolved through a combination of military campaigns and
        diplomatic negotiations, resulting in the tribes accepting Fredonian
        rule in exchange for autonomy.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>675:</strong> King Valerius implemented the Land Reformation
        Act, which aimed to redistribute land more equitably among the
        population. This act was designed to address internal discontent and
        enhance agricultural efficiency.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>725:</strong> The Revolt of the Merchant Class occurred as a
        result of economic inequalities and high taxation. The revolt was led by
        a coalition of influential merchants who sought greater representation
        and economic reforms. The revolt was eventually quelled, but it led to
        reforms that included the establishment of a council of advisors to
        represent various social classes.
      </p>

      <h2>Early 900s - Early 12th Century: Consolidation and Innovation</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>912:</strong> The War of the Three Rivers began as Fredonia
        sought to expand its control over the strategically important river
        valleys. The war saw a series of battles with rival kingdoms and ended
        with Fredonia securing control over the river regions, boosting its
        trade and economic influence.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>950:</strong> The Great Library of Fredonia was established,
        becoming a center for learning and innovation. The library attracted
        scholars and intellectuals from across the continent, fostering
        advancements in science, literature, and technology.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>1020:</strong> The Reformation of the Legal Code was carried out
        under King Leopold. This reform modernized the kingdom’s legal system,
        introducing new laws and regulations to better manage the growing
        population and complexities of governance.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>1085:</strong> The Invasion of the Northern Clans posed a
        significant threat to Fredonia. The northern clans, seeking to
        capitalize on internal instability, launched a series of raids.
        Fredonia’s military, under the command of General Marcus, successfully
        repelled the invaders and reinforced its northern defenses.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>1120:</strong> The Economic Boom of Fredonia occurred as the
        kingdom’s trade routes expanded and its economy flourished. Innovations
        in agriculture and trade led to increased prosperity and a higher
        standard of living for many Fredonians.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>1175:</strong> King Alaric initiated the Reformation of the
        Realm, a comprehensive overhaul of the kingdom’s legal and economic
        systems. This reform aimed to consolidate power, address internal
        issues, and prepare Fredonia for future challenges.
      </p>

      <h2>12th Century - 1499: The Era of Blood and War</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>1200-1250:</strong> The kingdom entered a period marked by
        relentless conflicts known as the
        <strong>Wars of the Crimson Tide</strong>. These wars were characterized
        by brutal battlesand constant invasions by hostile neighboring states.
        Fredonia faced multiple fronts of attack, which strained its resources
        and military.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>1265:</strong> The <strong>Siege of the Capital</strong> was one
        of the darkest periods in Fredonia’s history. Enemy forces, taking
        advantage of the kingdom's weakened state, advanced towards the capital.
        The city was besieged and suffered severe damage. The Fredonian
        defenders, under the command of the legendary hero Leonard Opalti, were
        pushed to the brink of defeat.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>1270:</strong> Leonard Opalti emerged as a beacon of hope. In
        the <strong>Battle of the Last Stand</strong>, Leonard, with a small
        regiment of men 4000~ man, faced overwhelming enemy forces(27600+ man
        from 3 different countries and multiple tribes gathered). Despite the
        odds, he led a fierce counterattack, personally killing over 2,700
        enemies and turning the tide of the battle. His leadership and bravery
        inspired the remaining troops to retake the stolen lands and push back
        the invaders.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>1275:</strong> The <strong>Treaty of Ashen Fields</strong> was
        signed, marking the end of the wars. The treaty forced Fredonia to
        concede 30% of its territory to the victorious enemy. The kingdom,
        though battered, began a slow process of recovery and rebuilding. The
        peace treaty marked the end of the bloodshed but left Fredonia with
        significant territorial losses and internal challenges.The crowning of
        the Hero helped to give the population hope for the future hard times.
      </p>

        <strong>1300-1400:</strong> Fredonia’s recovery from the wars was
        gradual. The kingdom focused on rebuilding its infrastructure and
        economy, restoring stability, and re-establishing its borders. During
        this period, Fredonia saw improvements in agriculture and trade, which
        helped stabilize its economy.

      <p>
        <strong>1440:</strong> The assasination of King Leonard III, the
        grandson of the legendary hero, triggered a succession crisis. The
        resulting civil strife, known as the

        kingdom and broke it to create 2 new countries
        <strong>The Free Tribes Union</strong> in the north and
        <strong>Kingdom of Finland</strong> in the south.
      </p>
      <p>

        <strong>Invasion of the Free Tribes Union </strong>. The Free Tribes,

        the second national hero Finn Hakon That reunited Fredonia Under a new
        banner New Kingdom of Finland, which eventually led to losses on both
        sides.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>1499:</strong> The
        <strong>Final Reforms of the Realm</strong> were initiated by the ruling
        monarch Finn Hakon That. These reforms aimed to address the kingdom’s
